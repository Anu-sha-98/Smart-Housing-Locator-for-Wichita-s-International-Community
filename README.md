This code focuses on analyzing and visualizing data using Python. The code begins by loading the dataset from an Excel file with Pandas and exploring its structure. It uses data cleaning and processing techniques to prepare the data for analysis. Visualizations, such as bar charts and other plots, are created using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to uncover trends, patterns, and relationships in the data. The project provides meaningful insights, making it easier to interpret and understand the underlying information.
